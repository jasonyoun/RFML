Note: Script should be run in the same directory as the data it will process
Data also expects a folder named "Output" to store the processed data

3 variables:

rowOffset: This says where the script should start looking for singal. In A data this looks like the first twn rows are just ID information, so set it to 10. I madei it a variable
in case this  changes across transmitters.

Threshold: I was unsure what you wanted for a viable signal, you can plug in the minimum value here. Currently it checks if both I and Q are are above this threshold. If so, that
data point in selected to be written to output column vectors.

Transmiter: Type in as 'A', 'B', etc.
